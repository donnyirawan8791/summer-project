# summer-project
This repository was created to practice everything that i learned when i was studying in university. it will include some beginner project that will be developed by time.

my name is Donny Irawan Bulhadie. i majored in computer engineering in middle east technical university. i am graduated now. i am thinking of learning of how to build an android app and game. By joining this forum, hopefully i could get help from people here. i have some basic in programming but i have no idea of how to start to build an android program. that's all i could say. please kindly give me a comment in each project i would build in the future. Thank all.
